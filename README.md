# Client Management System
This is a full-stack client management web application that allows users to manage client data with CRUD operations. The frontend is built using ReactJS, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface. The backend is powered by ExpressJS, handling API requests and connecting to a PostgreSQL database for data persistence. Users can add, update, delete, view client information such as name, email, job, rate, and status. Additionally, the application includes a search feature to easily find specific client data. The user interface is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and modern design.
